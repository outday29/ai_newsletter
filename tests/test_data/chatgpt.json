So what I did especially is that like I copy and paste the docs for 5.4 and you can make it save it to memory and so like. Oh my God it's crazy good. I hope it gets even better though because it kind of sucks at advanced stuff but that's okay. Advanced stuff lac pool processing better shader implementation on render view and like other complicated systems I don't know. I'm still a noob. I'm still learning too. So yeah and more on like the observer pattern and being able to modulate logic out of blueprints and just into the interfaces and stuff like that. So like yeah I'm a loser. I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm just learning too"
